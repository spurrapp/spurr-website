			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
			<h3>What is Spurr?</h3>
			<p>Do you want to be more active but lack the motivation? Spurr makes it more fun by creating a common goal for the whole team. As an example â€“ you can create a challenge to do 1,000 pushups in 7 days together. Watch statistics and everyones contributions towards your common goal.</p>
			
			<h3>How can start using Spurr?</h3>
			<p>Spurr is solely a Slack app thefore the only way to use it is by connecting it to your slack workspace. You can do it directly on the homepage spurrapp.com by clicking on the button 'Add to Slack'.</p>

			<h3>Is Spurr free?</h3>
			<p>Yes, at the moment you can use Spurr completely free of charge without any limitations (with the exception of the limitation of the product itself).</p>

			<h3>What kind of challenges can I do?</h3>
			<p>That's completely up to you but here are some ideas:</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Walk together 1,000,000 steps in a week.</li>
				<li>Make 1,000 push ups in 10 days.</li>
				<li>Make 5,000 squats in 10 days.</li>
				<li>100 cigarette-free days.</li>
				<li>50 coffee-less days.</li>
				<li>Read 5,000 pages in two weeks.</li>
				<li>Run 500 km in a month.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The goal always depends on the size of the team but should always be challenging. We recommend setting shorter challenges (1-2 weeks maximum) as they tend to be more engaging but it's up to you and your team.</p>
