Some states don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>

		<h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
		<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Let's Try To Sort Things Out First.</span> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Spurr, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto://hello@spurrapp.com">hello@spurrapp.com</a>. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Spurr may bring a formal proceeding.

			<span style="font-style: italic;">No Class Actions.</span> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.</p>

		<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
		<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Spurr with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>

			<h2>Modifications</h2>
			<p>We may revise these terms from time to time, and will always post the most current, operative version on our website and application - and notify all Spurr paid clients of any changes from version to version.
